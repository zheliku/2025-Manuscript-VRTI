\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ This paper proposes Virtual-Real Twin Interaction (VRTI), which synchronizes Virtual Interactive Objects (VIO) with Real Interactive Objects (RIO) to provide dynamic haptic feedback for gestures. Key innovations include: 1) \textbf {Dynamization of props' haptics}: Real-time sensor networks transform physical props' static properties into dynamic feedback through spatiotemporal synchronization. 2) \textbf {Gesture-props consistency model}: Achieves visuo-haptic synchronized interaction, and supports interaction calibration during hand manipulations. Applied to high school momentum conservation experiments, three VR twins (puller/button/knob) support grasping, pressing, and pinching. Controlled trials (VRTI: N=32 vs GI: N=32) demonstrate that VRTI: 1) Significantly enhanced motivation (p<0.001) and immersion (p<0.001). 2) Reduced extraneous cognitive load (p<0.001, |r|=0.625). 3) higher experimental understanding (p=0.05) and better comprehension application (p=0.005) }}{1}{}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ First, we propose Virtual-Real Twin Interaction (VRTI), a novel framework that extends passive haptic proxies by introducing real-time spatiotemporal synchronization between physical objects and virtual counterparts. Unlike prior static props, VRTI enables dynamic force feedback through sensor-actuator synchronization while maintaining precise virtual-real alignment during complex manipulations. }}{2}{}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ A VR twin is a fundamental interaction unit comprising a Real Interactive Object (RIO) in the physical world and its corresponding Virtual Interactive Object (VIO) in the virtual environment. The VIO provides visual feedback, while the RIO delivers haptic feedback. Crucially, VR twins enable users to interact through natural hand gestures without additional learning costs. Users perceive realistic haptic feedback during virtual interactions, mirroring the experience of manipulating real-world objects. }}{7}{}%
