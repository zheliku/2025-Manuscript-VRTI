\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ First, we propose Virtual-Real Twin Interaction (VRTI), a novel framework that extends passive haptic proxies by introducing real-time spatiotemporal synchronization between physical objects and virtual counterparts. Unlike prior static props, VRTI enables dynamic force feedback through sensor-actuator synchronization while maintaining precise virtual-real alignment during complex manipulations. }}{2}{}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ A VR twin is a fundamental interaction unit comprising a Real Interactive Object (RIO) in the physical world and its corresponding Virtual Interactive Object (VIO) in the virtual environment. The VIO provides visual feedback, while the RIO delivers haptic feedback. Crucially, VR twins enable users to interact through natural hand gestures without additional learning costs. Users perceive realistic haptic feedback during virtual interactions, mirroring the experience of manipulating real-world objects. }}{7}{}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(zheliku): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ VRTI established closed-loop interactive systems for scenarios requiring synchronized tactile authenticity, operational safety, and visual extensibility. It can be applied to the following three types of interaction scenarios. }}{11}{}%
